### Overview:
To predict the pricing of a used car during a live Exchange customer deal using the best suited Supervised Machine Learning algorithms.

### Motivation:
While I was working for TATA Motors during a live Exchange mela, many customers were confused about the current pricing of their old vehicles and didnt really trust the broker which took a considerable amount of time to offer a price. This led me to wonder if a machine learning algorithm would help solve this issue predicting the pricing of their old vehicles accurately within seconds!
